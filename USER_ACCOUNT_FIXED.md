## 🔵 About Google Sign-In

You mentioned Google Sign-In wasn't working. Here's the status:

### Current Status: ⚠️ Configuration Required

The Google Sign-In button is visible on the login page, but it needs additional setup on the backend to work. This is an **admin/developer task**, not something you need to do.

### What This Means for You

**For Now**:
- ✅ Use email/password login (fully working)
- ⏳ Google Sign-In will be enabled soon

**Once Configured**:
- You'll be able to click "Sign in with Google"
- Authenticate with your Google account
- Instant access to your dashboard

We'll notify users when Google Sign-In is ready!
